# Python-data-analysis

###  Pure Python Logic Building Projects

####  Overview

This repository contains a collection of **14 data analysis and logic-building projects**, all written in **pure Python** — without relying on external data analysis libraries such as Pandas or NumPy.

Each project focuses on solving analytical or real-world problems by applying **clean logic, data structures, and algorithms**, aiming to strengthen reasoning and problem-solving skills.

####  Objective

To master core Python programming and build a strong foundation for analytical thinking by writing clear, efficient, and logical code.

####  Key Features

* 14 individual projects written in **pure Python**
* Each project demonstrates different logic patterns (loops, conditionals, dictionaries, lists, functions)
* Well-structured and commented code
* Progressive difficulty — from beginner-friendly to advanced-level logic
* Focus on understanding *how Python thinks*, not just what it executes

####  Example Topics

* Data cleaning and summarization
* Custom aggregation and sorting
* Basic statistical logic without libraries
* Text and data manipulation
* Decision-making algorithms and rule-based systems

####  What I Learned

Through these projects, I improved:

* Problem decomposition and logical thinking
* Writing efficient Python code from scratch
* Building small data analysis pipelines without external dependencies
* Turning abstract logic into executable, testable code

####  Tools & Technologies

* **Python 3.14**
* **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**

####  How to Run

Clone the repository and open any project file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/farrux05-ai/Python-data-analysis.git
cd Python-data-analysis
python project_name.py
```

####  Future Plans

* Add small-scale datasets for applied examples
* Integrate visualization using only built-in modules
* Write medium posts explaining the logic behind selected projects
